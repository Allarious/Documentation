CVL Version 4
=============

CVL 4.0 (the CVL rewrite) is a major overhaul to the type system of CVL.  Many
of the changes are internal, but we also wanted to take this opportunity to
introduce a few improvements to the syntax.  The general goal of these changes
is to make the behavior of CVL more explicit and predictable, and to bring the
syntax more in line with solidity's syntax.

This chapter describes the language changes from CVL 3 to CVL 4, and contains a
migration guide to help you convert your specs.
